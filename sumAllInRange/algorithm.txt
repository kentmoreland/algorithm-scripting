> Find the largest number in the initial array
  > compare the two and pick the largest
> Store the highest number in a variable
> Store the lowest number in another variable
> create a variable for the current position
  > initiate the variable to the value of the highest number
> While the value of current is greater than or equal to lowest number
  > add current to the next lowest number
    > subtract one from current number to get the value to add
    > add that value to the current number
  > decrement current by 2
> When the value of current is equal to or less than the lowest number
  > return the sum
